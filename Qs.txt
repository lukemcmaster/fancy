1) what does this mean?
luke@lukes-mac:~/gitstuff/fancy (master=)$ git diff ~staged
fatal: ambiguous argument '~staged': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:
'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'

4)is the .git folder basically just always behind the actual folder, and when I commit all tracking and staged it brings the .git folder up-to-date? And when I checkout HEAD i bring the true folder back to the .git folder?

5)does ‘git push’ push everything or only the branch you are in? what does git push -u origin master then do?
