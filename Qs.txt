1) what does this mean?
luke@lukes-mac:~/gitstuff/fancy (master=)$ git diff ~staged
fatal: ambiguous argument '~staged': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:
'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'

2) I wanna try explain the branch diagram you originally sent

3) ctrl+c vs ctrl+u effectively do the the same thing?

4)is the .git folder basically just always behind the actual folder, and when I commit all tracking and staged it brings it up-to-date?
